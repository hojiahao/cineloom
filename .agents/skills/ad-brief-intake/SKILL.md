# Ad brief intake

A vague brief produces a generic film. Fix the few decisions everything else depends on,
then open the project so every later stage has one source of truth.

## Workflow

1. Extract what the request already states. Do not ask for it again.
2. Resolve the blocking unknowns, in this order, in one message: the product (and whether
   reference photos exist), the audience, the single message the viewer should remember.
3. Decide the rest yourself and say what you chose: platform, aspect ratio (9:16 for feed
   and short-video platforms, 16:9 for web and TV, 1:1 for marketplaces), duration (15 s
   default; 5 s steps because clips are generated in 5 s segments), tone, product category
   for compliance (`general`, `food`, `health_food`, `cosmetics`, `medical`).
4. Open the project:

   ```bash
   cineloom project init --id summer-soda --title "夏日气泡水" --brief "<one-paragraph brief>" --ratio 9:16 --duration 15
   ```

   The id is lowercase letters, digits and dashes.
5. Write `projects/<id>/brief.json` with the fields below (this is what every later stage reads). Put user-supplied reference
   images in `projects/<id>/refs/` and list them.

## brief.json fields

```json
{"id": "summer-soda", "title": "夏日气泡水", "product": "...", "category": "food", "audience": "...",
 "message": "the one thing the viewer should remember, in Chinese", "ratio": "9:16", "durationSeconds": 15,
 "tone": "tone and visual style, in English", "brandText": "the brand as printed on the product, at most 4 common characters",
 "proofPoints": ["claims the user can substantiate"], "references": ["refs/can_front.png"], "delivery": "local only | cloud allowed for <step>"}
```

`brandText` matters more than it looks: it is the only lettering that will ever appear inside a generated frame (on the product label, via the hero still), so keep it to common characters - the image model draws rare ones wrong ("泠" came out as "冷").

## Notes

- Record only claims the user can back up under "proof points". Anything else is a wish, and the script must not state it as fact.
- If the user says the product is unreleased or under NDA, write "local only" under delivery route. That line is what later stages check.
